Exaplanations:
	
Database:
	- A collection of related pieces of data, whose purpose is to solve the data management needs of an institution is called a Database.
	- Cannot understand the commands on its own,(DBMS is required for this)
	- Database store the data and provide a method/way to access it.
	(DBMS actually converts the queries into a meaningful command to invoke the method used to access the database.)
	
	Different Types of Database:
	Databases can be classified into four major types:
		- Relational database:
			Stores data in form of tables which are related to each other.
		- Hierarchical database:
			Follow a tree-like structure
		- Network database:
			Similar to Hierarchical ones, the only difference is one child is connected to many parents.
		- Object-oriented database:
			- An object database is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming.
			- RDBMS actually stores values in form of tables, but what if we make a separate table for some/all of the values in the table? That will become OOD
	
	Databases can be classified into four major types by model:
		- Relational Model Databases
		- Document Model Databases
		- Key Value Model Databases
		- Graph Model Databases
		- Wide Columnar Databases
	

DBMS: DataBase Management System:
	- Database management system is very complex software which save the data on the secondary storage devices and which are used to manipulate databases.
	- In simple word, it is a software used to perform different operations, like addition, access, updating, and deletion of the data(from database)
	- Acts as the backbone of a database and makes using a database a cakewalk as it makes access and management of data a lot easier.
	- DBMS actually understand the queries and help database to understand the requirements.
	  i.e. DBMS actually converts the queries into a meaningful command to invoke the method used to access the database.
	- Acts as connecting bridge between the database and the user

RDBMS: Relational DataBase Management System

SQL: Structured Query Language
